# usdc_transfers Substreams modules

This package was initialized via `substreams init`, using the `evm-events-calls` template.

Optionally, you can publish your Substreams to the [Substreams Registry](https://substreams.dev).

```bash
substreams registry login         # Login to substreams.dev
substreams registry publish       # Publish your Substreams to substreams.dev
```
